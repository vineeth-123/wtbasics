      <h1 style="color:black;text-align:center">AB de Villiers: Stillness and Speed</h1>

      <p>It's not as if he was required to show off an additional arrow in his bountiful quiver to make life hell for the bowlers. AB de Villiers already possesses a whole gamut of shots, some that he even plays as if he were a trapeze artist. On this balmy Monday evening at Sharjah, he indulged himself with another show of unadulterated AB-ness. It was the final over of the RCB innings and, by then, de Villiers was already at his venomous best, but this shot topped all of the six sixes he'd hit until then.

Andre Russell had switched to bowling from round the wicket, a move aimed at cutting de Villiers's hitting arc that had earned him a fair degree of success - just one boundary from six balls. As he ambled in, the permutations raced in the mind - a surprise short ball or go fuller? In line of the stumps or wider? The Jamaican arrowed in on the perfect yorker outside off-stump. It should have been enough against most batsmen, but obviously not for this most magical of hitters of a cricket ball. De Villiers moved deep and across and guided the ball with an open bat face over backward point for four. It was the cricketing equivalent of a shot that destroys the Death Star.</p>

      <h2 style="color:black;text-align:center">Curbing your ego, the Shreyas Iyer way</h2>

      <p>For Pravin Amre, Shreyas Iyer's long-time coach, maturity is about developing cricket smarts and curbing the ego. His ward threw a good bit of that advice out of the window and instead chose to 'back his strength' when he stepped out against Krunal Pandya and tried to hit him for a six on the long side of the boundary. It was a clean hit but ended up straight in the hands of Trent Boult at deep mid wicket. And with it, Iyer gave away his wicket after a good start, having scored 42 off 32 balls.

It was the third time in this IPL that Iyer had middled the ball in his bid to attack a spinner but ended up finding a fielder on the longer boundary. It's a case of falling for the dangling carrot with Iyer who has been dismissed more often by spinners - against whom he has a stronger game - in the last three seasons of IPL than the pacers.</p>

      <h3 style="color:black;text-align:center">Riyan Parag steps up as a middle-order lifeline</h3>

      <p>Doing a Tewatia' is a phrase that has become a part of the cricketing pop culture over the last two weeks. It simply refers to a remarkable turnaround, when a cricketer turns a seemingly impossible situation around. By that metric, Rahul Tewatia didn't exactly 'do a Tewatia' on Sunday (October 11) but he was on hand to play a starring role in yet another Rajasthan Royals heist.

In terms of the equation, the task wasn't as hard as the demons, personal and the opposition, he conquered against Kings XI Punjab more than two weeks ago. The circumstances were different and so were the challenges. But this time though, he had someone equally impressive at the other end.This was an extremely important game for Riyan Parag. After impressing in his role as a finisher in IPL 2019 for the Royals, he was touted as one to watch out for. Only 17 last year, Parag displayed maturity that belied his age and came up with some handy knocks. However, the golden-boy Parag quickly became the fall guy Parag at the start of IPL 2020 as the Royals lurched from one defeat to the next.

It is not like the Royals suddenly didn't rate him. In fact, they see a lot of potential in investing in Parag going ahead. He is involved in most of their marketing campaigns alongside the big names. His popularity saw a spike in the fan base for the Royals in the north east - a region where cricket plays second fiddle to football more often than not so much so that the franchise wanted to tap into that potential for a huge market by succeeding in their request to play a couple of home games at Guwahati.

However, four successive defeats in the ongoing campaign forced them to press the panic button and the axe fell on Parag. It stemmed from the fact that the Royals have been steadfast with some of their plans this season. They want to give their best batsmen every chance to face most of the 20 overs available. They sprung a surprise at the start of the tournament when Steve Smith continued to open alongside Jos Buttler. And on Sunday, it was Ben Stokes who slotted straight into that role in his first game of the campaign.</p>
